Due to high population density, poor evacuation infrastructure and exposure to severe weather events, developing countries are disproportionately exposed to the risks of natural disasters, and often have limited means to mitigate their effects. As a consequence, according to a World Bank study, more than 95 per cent of all deaths caused by disasters occur in developing countries. Last year alone an estimated total of 95.6 million people were affected by natural disasters, resulting in over 9000 deaths. Asia accounted for 70% of the total people affected.
Recent years have seen a sharp increase in online connectivity with more mobile users than ever before. We aim to use technology to help civilians and authorities in effective disaster management.

We aim to develop a cross-platform disaster management and surveillance system for real time warning, early emergency broadcast, forecast, tracking and first respondance support to natural calamities all over the world. The system is implemented in two phases.
